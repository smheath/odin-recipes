        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>I made these for a work potluck. They were a big hit!</p>

        <p>This is Natasha Kravchuk's recipe copied from <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/sausage-stuffed-mushrooms/">Natasha's Kitchen</a>.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs (20 count) large white mushrooms</li>
            <li>16 oz ground mild Italian sausage</li>
            <li>4 oz cream cheese, diced</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp finely chopped green onion or chives, plus more to garnish</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumbs (omit if gluten free)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Wipe mushrooms clean with lightly damp paper towels. Remove stems and scoop out the brown gills from inside the mushrooms, being careful not to break through the shell. Arrange mushroom caps with the opening facing up on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silpat.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook sausage until browned, breaking it apart with your spatula into crumbles. No need to add oil since the sausage will release plenty. Use tongs to push a paper towel around the bottom of the pan to soak up and discard excess oil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium/low and add 1 garlic minced garlic clove and 2 Tbsp chopped chives and stir 1 minute until fragrant.  Stir in diced cream cheese until it starts melting it’s ok if not completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and 2 Tbsp parsley.</li>
            <li>Divide stuffing mixture evenly between prepared mushroom caps then bake uncovered in the center of the oven at 400˚F for 15 minutes or until mushrooms are softened and topping is golden brown. Transfer sausage stuffed mushrooms to a serving platter and garnish with fresh parsley to serve.</li>
        </ol>
