        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>I love this cheese ball recipe. I make it every year for Christmas.</p>

        <p>This is Shawn Syphus's recipe copied from <a href="https://iwashyoudry.com/smoked-salmon-cream-cheese-ball/">I Wash You Dry</a>.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 to 6 oz. smoked salmon, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>16 oz. cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced fresh dill</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup walnuts, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Lay a large sheet of plastic wrap out on the counter out of the way.</li>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients except for the walnuts in a large bowl. Use clean hands to squish and mix the cream cheese and other ingredients together. Form the mixture into a large ball and place on top of the plastic wrap, then wrap up tightly. Place in fridge for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place chopped walnuts in a large bowl and then roll the cream cheese ball into the walnuts, gently pressing until cream cheese ball is covered with the nuts. Place on a serving platter with crackers and cucumber slices if desired. Enjoy!</li>
